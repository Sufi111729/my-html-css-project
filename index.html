        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I'm Muhammad Sufiyan, a passionate and dedicated Computer Science graduate with a strong foundation in software development and web technologies. With a B.Tech in Computer Science Engineering from Technocrats Institute of Technology & Science (TIT&S),
            Bhopal, I've honed my skills in programming languages like Java, C++, and JavaScript, and have a deep understanding of data structures and algorithms. Throughout my academic journey, I've worked on various projects, including a real-time chat
            application developed using Node.js, Express, and Socket.io. This project not only sharpened my technical skills but also provided me with hands-on experience in deploying applications on AWS and managing server maintenance. I'm particularly
            enthusiastic about frontend web development, where I can combine my problem-solving abilities with my creativity to design innovative and user-friendly interfaces. My proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, coupled with my commitment to
            continuous learning, allows me to adapt to the ever-evolving landscape of technology. Beyond academics, I've been an active member of the Coding Club â€“ Codung Ninja, and volunteered at Tech4Good, where I developed tech solutions for local
            non-profits. These experiences have instilled in me a strong sense of collaboration and the importance of using technology for social good. I'm now seeking a frontend web developer role where I can contribute to dynamic teams, work in agile
            environments, and continue to grow both personally and professionally. My goal is to create seamless and engaging user experiences that make a real impact.</p>
